## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Web components not rendering in React/Angular/Vue?**
  - Make sure to call `defineCustomElements()` from the loader in your app entry point.
- **Props not updating?**
  - For web components, pass props as strings (e.g., `data='[1,2,3]'`).
- **Styles not applying?**
  - Ensure Tailwind CSS is included in your project if you want to customize styles.
- **TypeScript errors in React?**
  - Add `/// <reference types="animated-charts" />` to your `global.d.ts` or use the provided React wrappers.
